<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Hunter Armor Upgrades</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This mod takes the classic Minecraft armor system and turns it into a system of upgrading.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This mod was heavily inspired by Monster Hunter's armor system whereas you can get armor and upgrade it up to 7 times to increase it's power level.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><br /><strong>Disabled Armor?</strong><br />This mod disables vanilla armor recipes except for leather - this mod is intended for difficult situations and interesting progression and all leather is the start.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Some materials for upgrading is only obtained through dungeon crawling or fighting bosses.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><b>How do I start?</b></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The first thing you'll need is an Armor Crafter. It's a fairly expensive upgrade but it opens the doors to exponential power upgrading.<br />Once you make that, you can put any piece of armor into the slot within the table and begin upgrading.<br />It supports every type of armor from every mod however it'll only use generic recipes for non-vanilla mods.<br /><br />The table will instruct you on the materials you'll need, and once you supply them you'll be able to upgrade the armor to the next level.<br />One you reach level 7 you'll push into the next tier. Leather -&gt; Iron -&gt; Diamond.<br /><br /><strong>Can I use this in a modpack?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Of course.</p>
