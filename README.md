Hunter Armor Upgrades

This mod takes the classic Minecraft armor system and turns it into a system of upgrading.

This mod was heavily inspired by Monster Hunter's armor system whereas you can get armor and upgrade it up to 7 times to increase it's power level.


Disabled Armor?
This mod disables vanilla armor recipes except for leather - this mod is intended for difficult situations and interesting progression and all leather is the start.

Some materials for upgrading is only obtained through dungeon crawling or fighting bosses.



How do I start?

The first thing you'll need is an Armor Crafter. It's a fairly expensive upgrade but it opens the doors to exponential power upgrading.
Once you make that, you can put any piece of armor into the slot within the table and begin upgrading.
It supports every type of armor from every mod however it'll only use generic recipes for non-vanilla mods.

The table will instruct you on the materials you'll need, and once you supply them you'll be able to upgrade the armor to the next level.
One you reach level 7 you'll push into the next tier. Leather -> Iron -> Diamond.

Can I use this in a modpack?

Of course.
